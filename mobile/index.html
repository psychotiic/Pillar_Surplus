         <p>One of my family's favorite hobbies is fishing.  We fish locally in some of the lakes in the area.  We also fish up north, on the Manistee River, as well as on many back waters of the river.  We fish for salmon, trout, pan fish, bass, walleye, pretty much whatever we can catch.  We have even unintentionally caught a turtle or two.  </p>

         <p>We have fun hiking in the woods, especially during mushroom season.  Early spring boasts the most sought after mushrooms, the Morels.  We usually have pretty good luck harvesting these up north by our property.  Mesick is the Morel mushroom capital of the world.  </p>

	       <p>We are off road enthusiasts.  There are over 600 miles of trails and a trail head right next to our property.  We love to go exploring, and sightseeing.  We even like to get into some challenging terrain, little mudding, water holes, and hill climbing.  There are two off road parks up north, Twisted Trails which is only a few miles away, and Rocks and Valleys which both offer lots of trails for stock to extreme build 4x4 vehicles.  </p>
